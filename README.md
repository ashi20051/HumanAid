# HumanAid
As the crime against women is increasing tremendously. According to NCRB, the crime against women is committed every 3 minutes. Safety Apps are proven to be a life-saving piece of technology, any human can get hold of at this juncture of time. These Apps can provide an invisible protective shield to the user of the app.
Our App HumanAid can provide such an invisible protective shield to the user. It will help people to tackle emergencies and will monitor mainly women and child safety. The basic idea is to build a user-friendly and robust application that can help individuals by sending SOS messages along with the current location and the app can be triggered with minimal effort.
